# Paint-By-Numbers (Crayon-By-Numbers)
The goal of this project was the convert any given image to a paint-by-numbers project that can be easily executed by the user. It relies on crayola crayon boxes (the source of which crayon is in which box, and the crayons' RGB codes is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors)). 

This project was completed by Ella Marrero, with the generous help of skimage documentation, online blogs, and stackexchange to determine best practices for image processing.
